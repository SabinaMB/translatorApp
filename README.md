# quickTranslate

A dynamic language translation tool built with React and Tailwind.

## Why I Built quickTranslate?

- **Strengthening React & Tailwind Skills:** Practiced state management, event handling, and styling with Tailwind to build a solid foundation.
- **Hands-on API Interaction:** Worked with a translation API to improve my skills in data fetching and asynchronous operations.
- **UI/UX Focus:** Designed a responsive, intuitive interface with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.

## Features

- **Language Selection:** Select languages from a dropdown with alphabet-based filtering for easy navigation.
- **Dropdown Behavior:** Closes automatically when clicking outside, using `useRef` and `useEffect`.
- **Input & Translation:** Input up to 200 characters with a live character counter; translations appear after clicking translate or pressing Enter.
- **Language Swapping:** Quick one-click swap between selected languages.
- **Filtered Search:** Filter languages by initial letter and reset to show all.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structured app layout.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styled the app with responsive, utility-first design.
- **React JS:** Managed state, events, and API calls, using hooks for dynamic UI.
- **API (MyMemory Translation):** Integrated translation API for fetching translations.
